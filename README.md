This repository contains the source code for the official Better Lyrics API - primarily serving as the backend for [Better Lyrics](https://better-lyrics.boidu.dev).

> [!NOTE]
> A few endpoints are defined as environment variables in the `.env` file. This is deliberate to prevent abuse of the API and to ensure that the API is used responsibly. If you would like to use a similar API for your own project, consider using something like [spotify-lyrics-api](https://github.com/akashrchandran/spotify-lyrics-api). This repository is intended to address privacy concerns and to provide a more transparent API for users.
